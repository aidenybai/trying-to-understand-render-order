## brain dump

Component trees run DFS, meaning a tree like below will be processed as: App -> A1 -> A2 -> B1

```
      App
     /  \
    A1   B1
   /
  A2
```

Triggers that occur at the top-most level (App) are easy to process. Even if there are multiple triggers (e.g. setState dispatches), they trickle down the tree when collecting the renders.

The problem occurs when a sub component resets the trigger. Let's say A2 sets the trigger (some state value is different, trigger happens to be reset). This means it becomes tracked as such:

```
      App (ðŸ”¥App)
     /          \
    A1 (ðŸ”¥App)   B1 (ðŸ”¥A2)
   /
  A2 (ðŸ”¥A2)
```

This no longer makes any sense. A2 is not the cause of B1's trigger, App is.

With hooks, this becomes a bit more complicated. Since hooks run "inline" to a component, the trigger needs to be populated up to the host component. For components, they can only "flow down"

```
      App (ðŸ”¥useApp) <- useApp (ðŸ”¥useApp)
     /              \
    A1 (ðŸ”¥useApp)   B1 (ðŸ”¥useApp)
   /
  A2 (ðŸ”¥useA2) <- useA2 (ðŸ”¥useA2)
```
